## About me

### The tl;dr version

I'm a developer, writer and speaker on web APIs and the future of the web. I work in developer relations for 
[Samsung Internet](https://samsunginter.net), Samsung's mobile web browser ([which may be bigger than 
you think!](https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/think-you-know-the-top-web-browsers-458a0a070175)).

### The longer version

I got interested in computers from an early age thanks to my older brothers. Thanks to them I was brought up with games 
consoles like the ZX Spectrum and the Atari 2600 (we had the wood version - a 
material which is totally underused in hardware these days!).

I followed my [brother Kevin](https://twitter.com/OshaughnessyKev) 
into studying computer science at university and I got my first job as a developer in 2003. 

Thankfully it only took me a couple more years to realise I should really give this "web development" thing a
proper go! I moved into "full stack" web development, before anyone called it such a thing, working primarily with Java, 
HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the next few years.

I guess my heart was always mostly in the front end. I remember getting excited about JQuery when that first came along, 
and then getting even more excited about HTML5! I've been mostly focused on the latest web APIs ever since.

For a few years, I explored new web (mostly) and native technologies in [Pearson's Future Technologies team](https://youtu.be/CsdUx31n-Zs). 
I learned a lot there about innovation. At this time I started to give my first talks at tech meetups in London.

Then at [pebble {code}](https://twitter.com/pebblecode) I led the development of a hybrid Bluetooth app for a global 
logistics company.

Now at [Samsung Internet](https://samsunginter.net), I am fortunate enough to be able to continue to do what I find most 
interesting, fun and rewarding: make demos, write articles, travel, give presentations and speak with developers about 
the latest web technologies.

My key technology interests are around how web and native app capabilities are converging (Progressive Web Apps etc) 
and how the physical and digital worlds are converging (Physical Web, Web Bluetooth, VR and Mixed Reality).
